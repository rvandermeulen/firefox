microsurvey:
  description: |
    This is a ping representing single events emitted by microsurvey messages,
    which are triggered by the messaging system. It is largely identical to
    messaging-system, except that it includes write-in responses from
    microsurveys, and it applies the write-in microsurvey data policy: reduced
    retention, stricter access control, OHTTP, and no client_id.
